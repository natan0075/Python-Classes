Heyo, I'm natan, 17 years old from Israel, loves gaming, drumming and what not. My mathematical skill level is i'd say pretty good. With programming I want to achieve a lot as I want to work in it in the future and gets lots of green goodies. I usually learn when it is passed to me in a fun/interesting way, but sometimes only reading it from somewhere is good enough. The only help you can give me through the proccess is the questions and answers, I should probably do everything else by myself :)
